##Notes from each step

#step1:
  setting up the repo

#step2:
  User stories: what a program is expected to do from clients perspective

  User stories -> functional system(objects & messages)(objects in system & how they interact) we call these systems Domain Models.

  Challenge: user story -> domain model

#step3:
  Domain Model: abstract representation of objects within a system, and the messages to get use to communicate with each other.

  Feature test: how will objects and messages work together?

#step4:
  Errors are gud

  show what the problem is and where to go to fix it

  Stack trace

#step5:
  to find out how to solve the error, a testing framework is needed (eg RSpec)

#step6:
  use 'require'

#step7:
  move between feature and unit tests
